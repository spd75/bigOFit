/** ContentMotherView controls which ScreenView is currently opened. The two possible ScreenViews that could be opened from this MotherView are:
        - Tabbed View: the main view of the app where the user can schedule workouts, create routines and exercises, view personal records, etc.
        - Active Workout Screen: the view used when a workout is currently taking place.
 
    Fields:
        - @ObservedObject viewRouter: object controls which screen is currently shown through the use of mother views
        - @EnvironmentObject activeHolder: the class which contains the current routine and workout selected to perform.
        - @Environment user: the object which contains all the information for the current user using the application
