/** SpecExercise represents everytime a genExercise is used during a workout. A Workout is made up of a series of SpecExercises, which holds the data for the amount of reps and weight performed.
 
    GenExercise is like the outline, SpecExercise is all the specific instances of that outline occuring.  For example, a Push-Up would be an example SpecExercise.  However, everytime I decided to do a set of Push-Ups, a SpecExercise would be used to represent this.
 
    Fields:
        - name: the name of the exercise, which is just assigned to genExercise.name
        - genExercise: the exercise which provides most general information for this SpecExercise
        - rest: A 2 integer array which contains the rest necessary after this exercise - rest[0] holds minutes, rest[1] holds seconds
        = @Published weight: the number of weight lifted when this exercise is performed
        - @Published reps: the number of repititions performed in this instance of
        - @Published weightStr: the string used to display the weight lifted in certain Views
        - @Published repsStr: the string used to display the number of repititions performed in certain Views
