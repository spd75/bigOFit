/** A Workout object provides all the information for an individual workout session. This is crucial for screens like the main Workout screen where
   a list of all workouts are displayed.
 
    Each Workout uses a Routine to outline its structure. Routines are a general outline for Workouts. Workouts, however, are specific instances of when a Routine is specifically performed.
 
    Fields:
        - workoutName: the name of the workout
 
        - dateComp: DateComponents which contain the information for the date and time that the workout is scheduled to occur
        - month: An integer value 1-12 which represents the month of the workout, starting with January
        - day: An integer value 1-31 which represents the day of the workout
        - year: An integer value which represents the year the workout takes place
        - weekday: an integer value 1-7 which represents the weekday of the workout, starting with Sunday
        - hour: the hour of the day in which the workout is set to take place
        - minute: The minute of the hour in which the workout is set to take place
 
        - groupName: the name of the group with which the workout will happen -> "Individual" if there isn't a group
        - imageName: the name of the image file associated with the workout
        
        - @Publihed started: boolean which is true when workout has started, false otherwise
        - @Published completed: boolean which is true when workout has been completed, false otherwise
        
        - routine: the routine that provides the outline for all exercises and rest periods
        - specExercises: the specific exercises which will store the data
        - exercisesPerformed: an array of all the genExercises contained within the routine
 
        - currentExerciseInd: holds the index for which exercise is currenlty being performed -- must have a count of 2 to be valid
        - currentExercise: the specExercise that is currently being performed
        - finalExerciseInd: the index for the final exercise in the routine
        - finalExercise: the final specExercise in the routine
